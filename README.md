Venom Bridge Tutorial 
What is Venom?
The Venom blockchain employs the Threaded Virtual Machine (TVM), a Turing complete machine capable of executing machine-level instructions, of facilitating the execution of smart contracts. However, other workchains on the Venom blockchain may use alternative virtual machines, such as the EVM.

‍

TVM operates on an asynchronous communication model between accounts, where only message sending can affect the state of another account. This design allows for concurrently processing multiple smart contracts, resulting in improved performance compared to traditional virtual machines. TVM is utilized to execute smart-contract code in the masterchain and basechain.
